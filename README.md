# Geometric Methods in Data Analysis

This repository contains the final project of the Geometric Methods in Data Analysis Course. 

##### Topic: Topological Data Analysis of a Financial Time Series for insights from Landscapes for detecting Financial Crashes

##### Content: Report and R code 


## About the Geometric Methods in Data Analysis Course
Thz course reviews fundamental constructions related to the manipulation of such point clouds, mixing ideas from computational geometry and topology, statistics, and machine learning. The emphasis is on methods that not only come with theoretical guarantees, but also work well in practice. 


## About the Project: Topological Data Analysis of a Financial Time Series for insights from Landscapes for detecting Financial Crashes 

The goal of this project is to replicate the results of the original paper by Gidea and Katz (2017) and draw special inferences on the usage of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) as a novel method to identify warning signs for impending financial crashes. This was done by a multivariate time series analysis of four major US stock market indices, namely the S&P 500, Dow
Jone Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ, and Russell 2000. The usage of persistent homology to identify and quantify topological patterns is illustrated here. Persistence of detected transient loops are measured and then encoded into real-valued functions referred to as 'persistence landscapes'. Their temporal changes are quantified via their Lp norms.
